# UFO Information Discovery with Javascript

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to provide an in-depth analysis of data involving UFO sightings, by allowing users to interact with the table on the webpage by filtering the table data for multiple criteria at the same time. using HTML, the webpage data was displayed and customized in a visually appealing format. Using Javascript, the webpage was made more interactive, by adding elements such as filter searches based on different criteria (such as UFO sighting year or city) that the user could input to get an updated table with only the elements specified in their input.

## Results
In order to use the webpage, the user would first need to input their desired filter criteria. For example, if the user would like to filter the table data by city, they would navigate to the 'City' filter search bar located on the lefthand side of the page, input the desired city (let's say El Cajon) and hit enter on their keyboard - as shown in figure 1. Once they've entered in El Cajon to the city filter search and pressed enter, the existing table will update to show only the UFO sightings that took place in El Cajon - as shown in figure 2. To reset the filter and display all of the UFO sightings data, the user must clear their previous input, and press enter once again.

## Summary
Although this new design allows you to filter your search on multiple conditions (thus allowing you to get more specific results back), one drawback is that you are unable to filter results based on 'OR' conditions - that is, you are unable to filter for sightings in El Cajon OR San Diego.

One recommendation for further development would be to allow for more filtering capabilities for the date filter - this would include allowing users to filter between certain dates (i.e. only show data for events that took place between 1/1/2010 and 2/1/2010). Another recommendation for further development would be to allow for OR filtering ability, so that users would be able to have an increased interactivity with the filtering options on the webpage
